"""
cot_schema — single source of truth for the CotWeekly serialization shape.

The cot_weekly table is denormalized: each row carries ~50 position fields
spanning category × side × crop-split, plus trader counts and per-market
extras. Two callers (routes/cot.py and scraper/export_static_json.py) used
to copy-paste near-identical dict builders that diverged subtly. This module
generates the dict programmatically so adding a new field is a one-line
change in one place — and the unit test locks the wire format.

Key design points:
  * Output dict KEY ORDER must remain stable. Downstream consumers compare
    JSON output across runs; reordering would produce noisy diffs.
  * The API endpoint (/api/cot) drops the old/other crop-split fields; the
    static export (cot.json) keeps them. Toggle via include_crop_split.
