"""
monthly_scraper.py — Runs monthly data sources that don't have their own flow.

Sources:
  ajca             — AJCA Japan green-coffee imports/stocks headline + DB
                     NewsItem (monthly). The monthly j-import report drives the
                     "AJCA Japan stocks" freshness row. NB: ajca.json (the
                     monthly stocks file) is still built by '3.5 – AJCA (Japan)'
                     (scraper/backfill_japan_stocks.py); this run only refreshes
                     the DB headline/NewsItem.
  psd_coffee       — USDA FAS PSD CSV. USDA publishes the coffee PSD twice a
                     year (June new marketing year + December revision), so this
                     only fetches in months 6 & 12 — NOT every month.
  usda_gain_pdf    — USDA GAIN Coffee Annual PDFs (forward-year forecasts
                     USDA only publishes in the narrative reports, never in
                     the CSV). Merged on top of psd_coffee in export_stocks.

NB on what is NOT run here (to avoid duplicate scrapes):
  • ECF port stocks → '3.4 – ECF stocks' (scraper/backfill_ecf_history.py).
  • ucda_reports    → '3.3.5 – Uganda UCDA' (scraper.run_monthly ucda).
  • un_wpp_age      → annual cadence → scraper/annual_scraper.py.

Called by .github/workflows/scraper-slow-data.yml (~12th of each month). PSD
self-gates to June/December inside run_monthly().
