"""
export_static_json.py — thin orchestrator.

Queries the database and exports static JSON files consumed directly by the
Vercel frontend (no live Render API call at page load). The per-topic exporters
live in scraper/exporters/<domain>.py; this module only owns the topic registry
(`_exporters`) and the run loop (`_run_exporters`, with `--only` topic slicing
and per-topic failure isolation).

    cd backend
    python -m scraper.export_static_json [--only cot,latest_prices,…]

Failure isolation
=================
Every topic exporter is invoked inside a try/except. A broken `cot` exporter
will no longer abort `news`, `freight`, `weather`, etc. — each topic runs
independently and the orchestrator logs which ones skipped. The `health`
exporter then runs last with the per-topic success map (`exporters_published_at`)
so a silently-failed topic shows up as stale in `health.json` and the daily
freshness workflow (1.5) raises a Telegram alert on the next cycle.

    enso) — those entries no longer special-case their failures because the

    for the topics that published successfully on this invocation.

    A topic that raises is logged + annotated and omitted from the returned
    map — the remaining topics still run. The outer caller passes the map
    to export_health so health.json's per-exporter timestamps reflect what
    actually published.

    DB session safety
    =================
    SQLAlchemy leaves a Session in an aborted-transaction state after a
    query raises — the next query attempt then fails with "This Session's
    transaction has been rolled back due to a previous exception" until
    rollback() is called. Without an explicit rollback per failure, this
    function's "isolation" would cascade the failure to every subsequent
    DB-touching exporter. The rollback() is always safe: no-op when no
    transaction is active, and we swallow any rollback-itself error so
    the loop continues even if the DB is unreachable mid-run.

    Failure surfacing
    =================
    Each failure prints a GitHub Actions error annotation in addition to
    the stderr log line. The annotation shows red in the Actions UI but
    does NOT change the job's exit code — so downstream workflow_run
    chains (redeploy-vercel, morning-brief) still fire normally with the
    topics that did publish. The persistent-failure signal lives in
    health.json["exporters"] and the daily 1.5 freshness check.
