refresh_intraday_kc_rc.py
Daily incremental refresh of intraday_kc_rc_15min.json — keeps the 15-min
RM+KC intraday points current so the open-direction model's two intraday
features (kc_after_rc_diff, rc_overnight_gap) don't go stale and freeze the
model's scored `as_of`.

The deep backfill (backfill_intraday_kc_rc.py, workflow 1.97) builds the full
~5.7y history from 59 contracts; that's heavy and manual. This refresh fetches
only the few NEAREST contracts (front + roll neighbours), volume-stitches them
with the SAME logic as the backfill (so the contract selection is identical),
extracts the recent days, and MERGES them into the existing file — recent dates
overwrite, all older history is preserved.

Scheduled (workflow 1.98) at ~20:13 UTC Mon-Fri, after both markets close and
before the 21:30 quant run (1.9), so the model picks up the fresh intraday the
same day. The current-day official settles aren't in the archive yet at that
hour (the OI workflow writes them ~02:00 UTC next day) — that's fine, the model
doesn't use the settle; the next refresh fills it in.

Usage (needs chromium):
    cd backend
    python -m scraper.refresh_intraday_kc_rc
