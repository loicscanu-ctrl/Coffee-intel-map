        <H>What problem it solves</H>
        <P>
          The CFTC/ICE Commitments of Traders (COT) report is <strong>weekly</strong> — it tells you where each
          trader cohort stood on the report Tuesday. Between prints we are blind. The <em>post-COT</em> block in the
          Overview is a <strong>nowcast</strong>: it estimates how positioning has probably shifted from the COT day
          up to the most recent daily data, so the read isn&rsquo;t stale by the time you act on it.
        </P>

        <H>Data sources</H>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI><strong>Weekly truth</strong> — <Code>cot.json</Code>: each cohort&rsquo;s long/short (managed money, PMPU,
            swaps, other reportables, non-reportables) on every COT Tuesday.</LI>
          <LI><strong>Daily detail</strong> — a per-contract archive of daily open interest <em>and</em> settlement
            price for every Arabica (KC) and Robusta (RM/RC) contract, ~5 years deep. This is what lets us see
            intraweek OI build/liquidation, the front price, and the curve structure day by day.</LI>
        </ul>

        <H>The model, step by step</H>
        <P>For each trading day in the window (COT day → latest), we read that day&rsquo;s change in total open
          interest and the front-contract price move, then:</P>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI><strong>Regime (which leg moved).</strong> The classic OI×price reading sets the dominant flow:
            price↑ &amp; OI↑ = fresh longs; price↓ &amp; OI↑ = fresh shorts; price↑ &amp; OI↓ = short-covering;
            price↓ &amp; OI↓ = long-liquidation.</LI>
          <LI><strong>Managed money share.</strong> MM is credited its share of that day&rsquo;s open-interest change
            (its share of total OI from the last COT), scaled by the size of the price move versus a 1% reference —
            a bigger move implies higher conviction. Moves under 0.1% are treated as directionless and skipped.</LI>
          <LI><strong>Counterparty.</strong> Every contract has two sides, so the opposite of MM&rsquo;s flow is the
            counterparty. <span className="text-slate-400">Producers</span> (short hedgers) sell into strength;
            <span className="text-slate-400"> roasters</span> (long hedgers) buy into weakness. That counterparty
            flow is split between industry (PMPU) and swaps/other reportables by their COT share of the relevant side.</LI>
          <LI><strong>Accumulate.</strong> The daily attributions are summed across the whole window, so a week with a
            down-day then an up-day is captured correctly rather than collapsed into a single endpoint comparison.</LI>
        </ul>

        <H>Direction is the signal; magnitude is rough</H>
        <P>
          Validated on the 5-year archive (~250 COT weeks per market), the model&rsquo;s <strong>directional</strong>
          accuracy is real — managed-money net, producers and roasters all land <strong>~66–70%</strong> sign-correct,
          versus a ~51–53% base rate (commercials do <em>not</em> simply add coverage every week). The <strong>size</strong>
          of the move is far less predictable: only ~0–5% better than assuming no change. So the lot figures shown are
          deliberately framed as approximate — read the arrow, not the decimal.
        </P>

        <H>Confidence tiers</H>
        <P>
          The one lever that genuinely improves reliability is signal strength. Binning industry calls by the size of
          the estimated flow, accuracy climbs sharply — so each producer/roaster line carries a confidence chip
          calibrated on the backtest:
        </P>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI><span className="text-emerald-400 font-semibold">high</span> — ~82–86% directional hit-rate.</LI>
          <LI><span className="text-amber-400 font-semibold">med</span> — ~67–69%.</LI>
          <LI><span className="text-slate-400 font-semibold">low</span> — ~60%, near the base rate; treat as tentative.</LI>
        </ul>
        <P>
          The tier cut-offs (33rd/67th percentiles of historical signal magnitude, in lots) are market-specific:
          Arabica <Code>{`low<${NY_PARAMS.confLow} · high>${NY_PARAMS.confHigh}`}</Code>,
          Robusta <Code>{`low<${LDN_PARAMS.confLow} · high>${LDN_PARAMS.confHigh}`}</Code>.
          Because the live window is often a <em>partial</em> week, early-week reads are small and will usually show
          &ldquo;low&rdquo; — by design: there isn&rsquo;t much information yet.
        </P>

        <H>Per-market calibration</H>
        <P>
          The two markets behave differently. On the backtest the magnitude-error curve is monotonic in opposite
          directions, so Arabica is given a higher MM-share multiplier ({NY_PARAMS.mmShareMult}×) and Robusta a lower
          one ({LDN_PARAMS.mmShareMult}×). Direction is unaffected by this lever; it only sizes the lot estimates.
        </P>

        <H>What was tried and rejected</H>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI><strong>Price-level z-score</strong> (the idea that commercials are contrarian on absolute price):
            scored ~46–51% for industry direction — worse than a coin flip — so it was not added.</LI>
          <LI><strong>Raw weekly price direction</strong> as the predictor: the day-by-day, OI-gated regime model
            beats it (e.g. roasters ~70% vs ~57–63%).</LI>

        <H>Caveats</H>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI>It is a <strong>nowcast, not a forecast</strong> — it explains the move that has already happened in OI and
            price, it does not predict next week.</LI>
          <LI>Magnitudes are approximate; lean on the direction and the confidence tier.</LI>
          <LI>The daily archive carries a ~1-day internal lag (price settles a day before OI is reported); immaterial
            at weekly cadence but worth knowing.</LI>
          <LI>The post-COT block only appears once daily data exists <em>after</em> the COT date; if the feed lags the
            release it hides rather than showing stale numbers.</LI>
        </ul>

        <H>Reproducing the numbers</H>
        <P>
          Everything here is regenerated by <Code>scripts/backtest-intraweek.mjs</Code> (run with
          <Code>node --import tsx scripts/backtest-intraweek.mjs</Code>), which replays every COT→COT interval covered
          by the archive, scores predicted vs. realized cohort deltas against zero- and proportional-OI baselines, and
          prints the per-market multiplier and confidence-tier calibration. The model itself lives in

        <H>Why frost is the trade that matters</H>
        <P>
          Frost is the single largest <strong>tail risk</strong> in coffee. Unlike drought, which trims a crop at the
          margin, a hard radiative frost in the southern Brazilian Arabica belt can kill leaf, scorch cherries and, in
          the worst case, set back trees for two seasons. The historical record is brutal and fast: the &ldquo;Black
          Frost&rdquo; of <strong>July 1975</strong> wiped out the bulk of Paraná&rsquo;s crop and is the reference event
          for the entire industry; <strong>June/July 1994</strong> saw two frosts that roughly doubled the price; and the
          <strong> July 2021</strong> freeze pushed Arabica from ~$1.20 to over $2.40/lb inside a few months. Each was a
          step-change, not a drift. The point of a frost monitor is therefore not precision — it is to flag, ahead of the
          news, that the <em>conditions for a step-change exist tonight</em>.
        </P>

        <H>The physics: air temperature is not the answer</H>
        <P>
          The naïve approach — &ldquo;frost when the 2 m air temperature hits 0 °C&rdquo; — systematically misses real
          frost events. Damaging frosts in the Brazilian winter are overwhelmingly <strong>radiative</strong>: on a
          clear, calm, dry night the ground and leaf surface radiate heat to space and cool <em>well below</em> the air
          temperature measured at the standard 2 m height. Plants are routinely damaged at recorded air temperatures of
          3–5 °C. So the model estimates the quantity that actually matters — the <strong>leaf-surface temperature</strong>
          — from the variables that govern radiative cooling.
        </P>

        <H>The model</H>
        <P>
          For each representative point we pull hourly forecast + recent history from Open-Meteo
          (<Code>temperature_2m, dew_point_2m, cloud_cover, wind_speed_10m</Code>), take the daily minimum-temperature
          hour, and estimate surface temperature as:
        </P>
        <P>
          <Code>T_surface = T_min − (1 − cloud/100) × max(0, 5 − 0.4 × wind_kmh) − 0.5·[dew &lt; 2°C]</Code>
        </P>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI><strong>Radiation term.</strong> <Code>(1 − cloud/100)</Code> switches the cooling off under overcast
            skies (clouds re-radiate heat back down) and on fully to a ~5 °C deficit under clear skies. The
            <Code>max(0, 5 − 0.4 × wind)</Code> factor kills the deficit once wind mixes the boundary layer — by ~12 km/h
            there is effectively no radiative drop. This is why a cold-but-windy or cold-but-cloudy night is <em>safe</em>
            while a milder, clear, dead-calm night is dangerous.</LI>
          <LI><strong>Dry-air correction.</strong> A further −0.5 °C when dew point is below 2 °C: dry air holds little
            latent heat, so there is no condensation to buffer the fall, and the surface keeps dropping.</LI>
        </ul>
        <P>Surface temperature then maps to a four-level risk code:</P>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI><span className="text-blue-300 font-semibold">H</span> — <Code>T_surface &lt; 0 °C</Code>: damaging frost likely.</LI>
          <LI><span className="text-blue-400 font-semibold">M</span> — <Code>0–3 °C</Code>: frost possible in low-lying pockets.</LI>
          <LI><span className="text-slate-300 font-semibold">L</span> — <Code>3–6 °C</Code>: cold, watch the trend.</LI>
          <LI><span className="text-slate-500 font-semibold">—</span> — <Code>≥ 6 °C</Code>: no frost concern.</LI>
        </ul>

        <H>Where we look</H>
        <P>
          Frost risk is point-sampled at the growing regions that actually freeze, not country-wide averages. In
          Brazil: <Code>Sul de Minas</Code>, <Code>Cerrado</Code>, <Code>Paraná</Code> (the southernmost and
          highest-risk belt) and <Code>Espírito Santo</Code> (Conilon/Robusta — included for completeness, rarely at
          frost risk). A secondary check runs only at Honduras&rsquo; high-altitude plots
          (<Code>Copán</Code>, <Code>Montecillos</Code>, &gt;1800 m), where frost is rare but possible. Each region shows
          a <strong>7-day worst-case badge</strong> (the most severe code in the coming week) plus a
          <strong> 14-day daily grid</strong> so an approaching cold front is visible days out.
        </P>

        <H>What was considered and deliberately left out</H>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI><strong>ENSO phase.</strong> El Niño/La Niña shift the frost window (the export carries context text like
            &ldquo;Paraná frost window +12 days&rdquo;), but the phase does <em>not</em> algorithmically move the
            temperature thresholds — it is decision context, not a model input, to keep the rule transparent.</LI>
          <LI><strong>Cold-air pooling / topography.</strong> Frost collects in valley bottoms that a single
            representative point cannot resolve. The &ldquo;M&rdquo; band (0–3 °C) is the practical hedge for this — it
            flags nights where sheltered low spots will freeze even if the point estimate does not.</LI>
          <LI><strong>Historical-recurrence probability.</strong> The 1975/1994/2021 events are background context, not
            terms in the formula. This is a <em>physical nowcast</em> of tonight&rsquo;s conditions, not a climatological
            frequency model.</LI>
        </ul>

        <H>Caveats</H>
        <ul className="space-y-1">
          <LI>It is a <strong>forecast-driven estimate</strong> and inherits the Open-Meteo forecast error; treat the
            outer days of the 14-day grid as indicative, not firm.</LI>
          <LI>Point sampling means the badge is a regional proxy — localized frost in unsampled micro-climates can occur
            without the badge lighting up.</LI>
          <LI>The rule runs year-round but is only materially informative in the austral winter (≈ May–August); in summer
            it will correctly read &ldquo;—&rdquo; every night.</LI>
        </ul>

        <H>Where it lives</H>
        <P>
          The estimate is computed in <Code>backend/scraper/sources/farmer_economics.py</Code> (<Code>_frost_risk</Code>),
          mirrored for Honduras in <Code>honduras_weather.py</Code>, published into <Code>farmer_economics.json</Code>,

          The London Robusta contract — rulebook <strong>Section GGGG</strong> — is the global benchmark for
          <strong> Robusta</strong> (<em>Coffea canephora</em>). It is sized and priced per <strong>tonne</strong> and
          settles into European/UK/US warehouse delivery, with a tiered quality-class allowance schedule rather than a
          single deliverable grade.

      <H>Why fertilizer is a coffee signal</H>
      <P>
        Fertilizer is the largest cash input on a coffee farm and the one that swings most violently with the global
        energy and macro cycle. It matters on two clocks. <strong>Short term</strong> it is a cost-push lever: when urea
        or potash spike, the farm-gate break-even rises and marginal growers come under margin pressure.{" "}
        <strong>Medium term</strong> it is a yield lever &mdash; when fertilizer turns expensive relative to the coffee
        price, growers cut application rates, and coffee, a perennial, pays that back as weaker bean fill and lighter
        crops one to two seasons <em>later</em>. The fertilizer page is therefore a leading read on future supply, not
        just a current cost line.
      </P>

      <H>The three nutrients we track</H>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI><strong>Nitrogen &mdash; Urea (N).</strong> Drives vegetative growth and is the single biggest nutrient
          demand for coffee; its price is tied to natural gas, so it moves with the energy complex.</LI>
        <LI><strong>Phosphate &mdash; MAP/DAP (P).</strong> Root and cherry development; priced off ammonia, sulphur and
          phosphate rock.</LI>
        <LI><strong>Potassium &mdash; KCl / potash (K).</strong> Coffee is a notably heavy potassium feeder &mdash; K
          governs bean filling in the cherry-development window. Potash supply is concentrated in a handful of producers
          (Canada, Russia, Belarus), so it carries supply-shock and sanction risk.</LI>
      </ul>

      <H>Data sources</H>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI><strong>Benchmark prices</strong> &mdash; the World Bank <em>Commodity Markets &ldquo;Pink Sheet&rdquo;</em>{" "}
          monthly series for Urea, DAP and KCl (<Code>urea_monthly</Code>, <Code>dap_monthly</Code>,{" "}
          <Code>kcl_monthly</Code> plus full history). The source Excel&rsquo;s document ID rotates on every update, so
          the scraper discovers the current URL dynamically rather than hard-coding it.</LI>
        <LI><strong>Import volumes &amp; origins</strong> &mdash; Comex-Stat (Brazil) and Vietnam customs data for monthly
          fertilizer imports and the country-of-origin mix, surfacing import dependence and origin concentration.</LI>
        <LI><strong>Application calendar</strong> &mdash; the agronomic window that flags when the next major fertilizer
          pass falls in the crop cycle, so a price spike can be read against whether buying is imminent or months off.</LI>
      </ul>

      <H>How it transmits to the crop</H>
      <P>
        Brazil and Vietnam &mdash; the two largest origins &mdash; import the large majority of their fertilizer, so the
        delivered cost is the World Bank benchmark <em>plus</em> ocean freight <em>plus</em> the local-currency move
        (BRL, VND). The farm-gate input cost is thus a three-way function of nutrient price, freight and FX &mdash; which
        is why a flat dollar urea price can still squeeze a Brazilian grower if the real weakens.
      </P>
      <P>
        The reference shock is <strong>2021&ndash;22</strong>: natural-gas prices drove urea up while the Russia/Belarus
        disruption tightened potash, lifting all three nutrients to multi-year highs. Growers responded by trimming
        application &mdash; the kind of move that surfaces in yields with a lag, which is why the panel pairs current
        prices with the longer history.
      </P>

      <H>Where it shows up in the app</H>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI><strong>Macro tab</strong> &mdash; the fertilizer-inputs panel plots the World Bank price history for the
          three nutrients.</LI>
        <LI><strong>Supply &rarr; Farmer Economics</strong> &mdash; current nutrient prices, the Brazil/Vietnam import
          mix and the application calendar, feeding the production-cost / break-even view.</LI>
      </ul>

      <H>Caveats</H>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI>The Pink Sheet is a <strong>global benchmark</strong>, not a farm-gate price: real delivered cost adds
          freight, FX, blending and retail margin, and varies by region.</LI>
        <LI>The price&rarr;yield link is <strong>real but lagged and noisy</strong> &mdash; weather usually dominates any
          single season, so read fertilizer as slow background pressure, not a timing signal.</LI>
        <LI>Benchmark prices are <strong>monthly</strong> and import data lags by weeks; treat the read as a trend, not a
          daily mark.</LI>

          UGA S15 Robusta — FOBbing cost ~${FOBBING_USD["UGA S15"]}/t
        </h3>
        <P>
          Uganda&#39;s logistics cost is dominated by one line: the <strong>Northern Corridor</strong>. As a
          landlocked country, all export coffee must travel 1,150 km by road to the port of Mombasa, Kenya. That
          transit adds a cost and a time premium that no policy change can eliminate short of a rail upgrade. On top
          of the transit, UCDA imposes a 1% export cess (the Uganda Coffee Development Authority levy), and
          sun-drying shrinkage is a material physical cost that doesn&#39;t appear in freight quotes.

          <strong>Trader note:</strong> The Northern Corridor rate is the most volatile element across the three
          origins. East African road-freight tightens during harvest season (Oct–Jan), when trucks are competing with
          tea, grain and maize exports from Kenya and Tanzania. A $10–15/t swing in the corridor rate shows up
          directly in Uganda&#39;s effective FOB cost within weeks. UCDA cess is the other watch item: it scales
          with price, so every $300/t rally in RC adds ~$3/t to the cess line.

          Guatemala is the first <strong>Arabica</strong> origin in this table, so its cost stack is benched against
          ICE New York (KC), not London. Guatemalan SHB (Strictly Hard Bean, grown above ~1,350 m) is fully washed,
          which front-loads the cost into <strong>milling</strong>: parchment is dry-milled, hulled, density- and
          screen-graded, and hand/electronically sorted to export grade. ANACAFE publishes the daily
          <Code>Precio de referencia</Code> for café oro per quality (Prima lavado / Duro / Estrictamente duro) that
          feeds the GT SHB ticker. Export runs through the Pacific (Puerto Quetzal) or, for Atlantic-routed lots,

          <strong>Trader note:</strong> Milling and exporter margin are the swing lines — washed-Arabica prep cost is
          quality-elastic (cleaner parchment mills cheaper). Because the ANACAFE reference is itself derived from the
          NY &apos;C&apos; close, the GT SHB ticker N-diff hovers near the negative of ANACAFE&#39;s built-in deduction; a move
          toward zero signals the physical bidding up toward C parity (tight prompt highland supply or a quality bid).

          These figures are structural: they set the <em>floor</em> of what origin must offer relative to RC futures
          for an export trade to work. When the ticker N-diff is <strong>close to zero</strong>, origin is priced at
          futures parity and export is marginally viable. When it is <strong>deeply negative</strong> (e.g. N-200),
          origin is offering a substantial discount — either oversupply at origin, logistics disruption, or currency
          effects. When it is <strong>positive</strong>, origin is at a premium to futures, which typically signals
          tight prompt supply or a quality bid.

        <P>
          A <strong>CIF</strong> price covers the coffee delivered to the destination port — cost, insurance and ocean
          freight to the quay. But a roaster buys coffee <strong>in-store</strong>: green resting in a destination
          warehouse, customs-cleared, reweighed and (where required) re-bagged, ready to call off. The{" "}
          <strong>CIF-to-in-store</strong> cost is the chain of expenses that bridges those two points — the mirror
          image of the <Code>FOBbing cost</Code> on the origin side.
        </P>
        <P>
          Everything below is priced in <strong>USD</strong> and is <strong>dynamic</strong>: handling quotes given in
          EUR are converted at the live <Code>EUR/USD</Code>, while the value-based lines (weight-loss, insurance) and
          the <strong>financing</strong> are computed off today&rsquo;s <strong>Vietnam FAQ</strong> price as the goods
          value. As the daily FAQ print and EUR/USD move, every figure re-prices.

          Each port also carries the <strong>ocean freight</strong> leg (Vietnam → port), pulled from the{" "}

          per-destination multiplier — the same FBX-multiplier method the freight section uses for its estimated
          corridors — then divided over the {CONTAINER_MT} mt container to a per-tonne rate. North-range ports
          (Rotterdam/Hamburg/Le&nbsp;Havre/Bremen) sit on the base; Mediterranean and Oceania lanes are scaled proxies
          (flagged <em>~est</em>). The <strong>delivered</strong> total adds freight to the in-store stack for a full

      <H2>What this page documents</H2>
      <P>
        The <strong>Demand → Certified Stocks</strong> tab visualises the ICE-deliverable inventory the coffee
        futures market clears against — Arabica (Coffee &ldquo;C&rdquo; / KC, US warehouses) and Robusta (RC,
        European warehouses) — and decomposes each period&rsquo;s change into three flows: <strong>in</strong>{" "}
        (newly graded coffee that stayed), <strong>in &amp; out</strong> (graded <em>and</em> decertified inside the
        same window), and <strong>out</strong> (older stock that left). This document explains exactly how those
        numbers are computed, the formulas, and the cohort model that makes &ldquo;in &amp; out&rdquo; meaningful.
      </P>

      <H2>The core problem</H2>
      <P>
        The exchange publishes a <strong>daily certified-stock total</strong> and a <strong>daily grading count</strong>,
        but these are two different ledgers. In a quiet week they reconcile; in a busy week they do not. If 850 bags
        pass grading while the total stock <em>falls</em> 14,722, naïvely netting per-origin daily deltas makes the
        fresh gradings cancel against same-week decertifications and <em>vanish</em>. The model below fixes that by
        treating gradings and decertifications as separate flows and only merging them into &ldquo;in &amp; out&rdquo;
        once an <strong>ageing report</strong> lets us match cohorts.
      </P>

      <H2>Cohorts — the unit of accounting</H2>
      <P>Every graded lot is labelled by a <strong>cohort</strong>, the atomic key all flows are tracked against:</P>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI><strong>Arabica:</strong> <Code>(grading date, origin, port)</Code>.</LI>
        <LI><strong>Robusta:</strong> <Code>(grading date, origin, port, class)</Code> — class is the C-contract
          quality tier (1 = par, 2 = −$30/t, 3 = −$60/t, 4 = −$90/t).</LI>
      </ul>
      <P>
        For cohort arithmetic the <em>grading date</em> is bucketed to its <strong>calendar month</strong>
        (<Code>cohort_id = YYYY-MM</Code>). The monthly ageing report tells us, per cohort, how many lots are still on
        warrant — comparing two consecutive reports gives each cohort&rsquo;s shrinkage.

        Each day we maintain a <strong>theoretical stock</strong> per origin and port (Arabica) or per port (Robusta,
        whose daily report carries no origin breakdown):
      </P>
      <Fml>{`theoretical(t) = stock_report(reference_date)
               + Σ passed_gradings(reference_date … t)`}</Fml>
      <P>
        Real (reported) stock can only be <strong>equal to or below</strong> theoretical — coffee can leave, it cannot
        appear without being graded. The gap is what left:
      </P>
      <Fml>{`out(window) = theoretical − real
            = Σ passed_gradings − (stock_end − stock_start)
            = passed − netΔ        (netΔ = stock_end − stock_start)`}</Fml>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI>If real = theoretical → nothing left; <strong>all passed gradings are &ldquo;in&rdquo;</strong>, out = 0.</LI>
        <LI>If real &lt; theoretical → the difference is <strong>&ldquo;out&rdquo;</strong>.</LI>
      </ul>

      <H2>When does &ldquo;in &amp; out&rdquo; appear?</H2>
      <P>
        Crucially, <strong>before an ageing report we cannot know which lots left</strong> — the freshly graded ones or
        old stock. So the model shows:
      </P>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI><strong>No ageing report inside the window</strong> → <Code>in = passed</Code>, <Code>out = passed − netΔ</Code>,
          and <Code>in &amp; out = 0</Code>. This is the &ldquo;assume nothing until month-end&rdquo; state.</LI>
        <LI><strong>An ageing report falls inside the window</strong> → we match cohorts (below) and reclassify part of
          the gradings as &ldquo;in &amp; out&rdquo;.</LI>
      </ul>
      <P>
        The Certified Stocks panel surfaces this with a per-market caption: <em>&ldquo;in &amp; out pending next ageing
        report&rdquo;</em> vs <em>&ldquo;in &amp; out matched (ageing report)&rdquo;</em>.
      </P>

      <H2>Worked example (the design case)</H2>
      <P>
        Today is June 6; we look at the last week. <strong>850</strong> bags passed grading and total stock fell
        <strong> 14,722</strong>. Before the month-end ageing report:
      </P>
      <Fml>{`in       = 850                       (all passed)
out      = 850 − (−14,722) = 15,572   (passed − netΔ)
in & out = 0                         (no ageing report yet)
check:   in − out = 850 − 15,572 = −14,722  ✓`}</Fml>
      <P>
        At month-end the ageing report arrives. Suppose the June cohort (this month&rsquo;s gradings) shows a net
        <strong> +278</strong> still on warrant, while old cohorts (e.g. Jan-26) shrank <strong>15,000</strong>. We can
        now split the 850:
      </P>
      <Fml>{`in & out (transit) = 850 − 278 = 572   (graded then left)
in (pure)          = 278               (graded and stayed)
out (legacy)       = 15,000            (old cohorts decertified)
check: in − (in&out + out) = 278 − (572 + 15,000) = −14,722  ✓`}</Fml>

      <H2>Cohort-DNA: inferring Robusta origins</H2>
      <P>
        The Robusta daily stock report has <strong>no per-origin breakdown</strong> — only port totals. We recover
        origins with the <strong>cohort-DNA</strong> algorithm:
      </P>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI><strong>DNA</strong> — for each <Code>(port, cohort)</Code>, the normalised origin split of the gradings
          recorded that month: <Fml>{`DNA[port][cohort][origin]
  = graded_lots[port][cohort][origin] / Σ_origin graded_lots[port][cohort]`}</Fml></LI>
        <LI><strong>Shrinkage</strong> — between consecutive month-end reports RP<sub>t−1</sub> → RP<sub>t</sub>, each
          cohort&rsquo;s lost lots: <Fml>{`shrink[port][cohort] = max(0, lots_in_RP(t−1) − lots_in_RP(t))`}</Fml>
          A cohort first appearing in RP<sub>t</sub> (just graded) instead uses
          <Code>shrink = max(0, graded_total − lots_in_RP(t))</Code>.</LI>
        <LI><strong>Apportion</strong> — distribute each cohort&rsquo;s shrinkage to origins by its DNA:
          <Fml>{`implied_outflow[port][origin]
  = Σ_cohort shrink[port][cohort] × DNA[port][cohort][origin]`}</Fml>
          When a cohort predates our gradings history (no DNA), we fall back to the port&rsquo;s all-time origin mix;
          a coverage guard (gradings &lt; 50% of the bucket) also triggers the fallback.</LI>
      </ul>

      <H2>Cohort-resolved &ldquo;in &amp; out&rdquo;</H2>
      <P>
        To split the matched window exactly, the backend emits — alongside total <Code>implied_outflow</Code> — a
        <strong> transit subset</strong> <Code>by_port_transit</Code>: the outflow from cohorts graded <em>inside the
        same interval</em> (the &ldquo;new cohort&rdquo; shrinkage only). By construction
        <Code> by_port_transit ⊆ by_port</Code>, so:
      </P>
      <Fml>{`transit  (in & out) = Σ_window by_port_transit[port][origin]
out_total           = Σ_window by_port[port][origin]  (+ recent daily sim)
pure_out            = out_total − transit
in_total            = Σ_window gradings[port][origin]

per origin, clamped so every bucket ≥ 0:
  t        = clamp(transit, 0, min(in_total, out_total))
  in_pure  = in_total  − t
  out_pure = out_total − t`}</Fml>
      <P>
        For the Feb worked example (cohort 2026-02 graded 100 lots, 80 remain, DNA 75% Vietnam / 25% Indonesia):
        transit = 20 lots → <strong>15 Vietnam + 5 Indonesia</strong> in &amp; out, while older cohorts&rsquo;
        shrinkage (10 lots) stays pure out — total outflow 19 Vietnam / 11 Indonesia.
      </P>

      <H2>The four density-grid buckets</H2>
      <P>Each warehouse card draws warrants (1 square = 1 warrant: KC ≈ 37,500 lb ≈ 283 bags; RC = 10 t = 1 lot) in four buckets:</P>
      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI><strong>existing</strong> — stock present at window start that&rsquo;s still here:
          <Code> existing = current − net_gained</Code> (inherits the port&rsquo;s age mix).</LI>
        <LI><strong>net gained (in)</strong> — graded and stayed (green dashed, fresh age).</LI>
        <LI><strong>in &amp; out (transit)</strong> — graded then left (amber dashed); only non-zero when cohort-matched.</LI>
        <LI><strong>lost / out</strong> — older stock that left (red ghost squares).</LI>
      </ul>
      <P>Invariants that always hold:</P>
      <Fml>{`current   = existing + net_gained
gross_in  = net_gained + transit
gross_out = lost       + transit`}</Fml>

      <H2>Arabica: per-origin gradings (exact, with a fallback)</H2>
      <P>
        Since ~June 2026 ICE publishes the &ldquo;TODAY&rsquo;S GRADING SUMMARY&rdquo; as an{" "}
        <strong>origin × port matrix</strong> (a <Code>BAGS PASSED GRADING</Code> table, then a
        <Code> BAGS FAILED GRADING</Code> table), not the old <Code>&ldquo;825 Bags Passed Today&rdquo;</Code> one-liner.
        We parse the full matrix, so on action days the &ldquo;in&rdquo; is sourced <strong>exactly</strong> per
        <Code> (origin, port)</Code> — the same fidelity as Robusta gradings:
      </P>
      <Fml>{`in[port,origin] = Σ_window passed_by_origin[origin][port]   (exact)

net_gained = max(in, max(0, netΔ))
lost       = net_gained − netΔ`}</Fml>
      <P>
        Only for days that lack the matrix (legacy/no-action reports, or history captured before the matrix parser
        shipped) do we fall back to distributing the <em>uncovered</em> passed bags <Code>P_remainder</Code> by where
        stock grew:
      </P>
      <Fml>{`in[port,origin] += P_remainder × ( max(0, Δ[port,origin]) / Σ max(0, Δ) )
   P_remainder = passed_total − Σ matrix-covered gradings`}</Fml>
      <P>
        So the per-origin split is now <strong>exact when the matrix is present</strong> and only an inference for the
        residual; the aggregate in/out totals are exact either way.
      </P>
      <H2>Arabica in &amp; out — the daily FIFO ledger</H2>
      <P>
        The ICE monthly ageing report (<Code>coffee_aging_YYYYMMDD.xls</Code>) turned out to be laid out as
        <strong> age-in-days × port</strong> with <em>no origin column</em>, and its day-buckets don&rsquo;t support a
        clean report-to-report cohort match (a 0–120-day lumped young bucket, fixed bins that a cohort drifts across as
        it ages, and non-uniform ~30-day intervals). Prototyped against real April→May files it <strong>overcounted
        outflow ~2.3×</strong> versus the exact mass balance — so it&rsquo;s not the right engine for Arabica.
      </P>
      <P>
        Instead we use what Arabica has and Robusta doesn&rsquo;t: <strong>exact daily per-(origin, port) stock</strong>
        plus exact per-origin gradings. So in/out are computed, not inferred, and in &amp; out comes from a per-(origin,
        port) <strong>FIFO ledger</strong>:
      </P>
      <Fml>{`in[port,origin]  = Σ_window gradings                         (exact)
out[port,origin] = Σ_window daily decertifications           (exact)
seed: start-of-window stock = the oldest ("LEGACY") cohort
each day:  add that day's gradings as a new cohort
           remove the day's decert FIFO — oldest first
in & out (transit) = decerted bags whose cohort was graded in-window`}</Fml>
      <P>
        Oldest-leaves-first is also the realistic tender order, since age allowances penalise old warrants. A key
        consequence (and a good sanity check): when a window&rsquo;s gradings are small relative to a large outflow of
        old stock, <Code>in &amp; out ≈ 0</Code> — the fresh lots stayed, the old stock left — which is exactly the
        model&rsquo;s &ldquo;850 in, big out, 0 in &amp; out&rdquo; case. The ageing report still earns its keep: it
        powers the age fade / age tiles and independently validates the ledger&rsquo;s young-cohort survivors. The
        per-market caption reads <em>&ldquo;in &amp; out · daily per-origin ledger (FIFO)&rdquo;</em> for Arabica.
      </P>

      <H2>The period selector</H2>
      <P>
        The window is <Code>[start, end]</Code>. <strong>End</strong> is a calendar pick defaulting to the latest
        available data date (bounded to the data range). <strong>Start</strong> is chosen relative to end:
        <Code> end − 7 days</Code>, or the 1st of end&rsquo;s month (month-to-date — the default view) and the 1st of
        each earlier month. Every aggregation above is clamped to this window, and current stock is framed off the last
        snapshot at or before <Code>end</Code>.
      </P>

      <ul className="space-y-1">
        <LI><strong>Arabica per-origin flows are exact on action days</strong> — the June-2026+ grading matrix gives a
          real <Code>(origin, port)</Code> split. Only days without the matrix (legacy text reports, or pre-matrix
          history) fall back to a distribution for the uncovered bags. Aggregate totals are exact either way.</LI>
        <LI><strong>Robusta origins are modelled</strong> via cohort DNA; thin gradings history falls back to a
          port&rsquo;s all-time mix.</LI>
        <LI><strong>in &amp; out lags the ageing report</strong> — intra-month it reads 0 by design; it resolves at the
          next month-end. Same-month decertifications after the last report are surfaced via a daily stock simulation as
          pure out (never as in &amp; out).</LI>
        <LI><strong>transit is clamped to in-window gradings</strong> — if cohort DNA attributes more shrinkage to an
          origin than the window&rsquo;s recorded gradings, the excess stays in pure out, since in &amp; out can never
          exceed what arrived.</LI>
