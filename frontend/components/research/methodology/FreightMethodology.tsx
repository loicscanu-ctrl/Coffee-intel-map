    >
      <P>
        The Freight tab carries three independent signals, each answering a different question. <strong>Container
        rates</strong> (USD/FEU) price the ocean leg that moves coffee to roasters. The <strong>dry-bulk indicator</strong>
        proxies the cost pressure on <em>fertilizer</em> shipped into Brazil — an input cost, not a coffee cost.
        And <strong>port activity</strong> reads physical throughput at origin gateways from satellite AIS. This paper
        documents how each is estimated, with the formulas and their limits.

      <H2>1 · Container freight — the FBX-multiplier route model</H2>
      <P>
        Coffee ships in 40-ft containers, but no public daily index exists for most coffee export lanes
        (Santos→Rotterdam, Djibouti→Rotterdam, …). The Freightos Baltic Index (FBX) publishes only a handful of major
        lanes, nearly all East-Asia origin. The model takes the three FBX lanes that <em>are</em> public and treats each
        coffee corridor as a <strong>scaled version of the closest FBX lane</strong>.
      </P>
      <UL>
        <LI><strong>FBX11</strong> — China/East Asia → North Europe. The workhorse base.</LI>
        <LI><strong>FBX01</strong> — China/East Asia → North America West Coast.</LI>
        <LI><strong>FBX03</strong> — China/East Asia → North America East Coast.</LI>
      </UL>
      <P>
        Vietnam routes are treated as <em>direct</em> (Vietnam ≈ China sailing dynamics, multiplier ≈ 1). South-American
        and African lanes have no equivalent index, so they ride FBX11 as a <strong>directional proxy</strong>, scaled
        down by a fixed multiplier and flagged <Code>~est</Code> so the user knows it is an estimate rather than a
        measurement.
      </P>
      <RefTable

      <P>The rate and its weekly change come straight off the index:</P>
      <Fml>{`rate  = round( latest_FBX_rate × multiplier )      [USD/FEU]
prev  = round( prev_FBX_rate   × multiplier )      (else prev = rate → 0 change)
prev_FBX = most recent FBX print strictly older than 7 days`}</Fml>
      <P>
        Using &ldquo;strictly older than 7 days&rdquo; (rather than exactly −7d) absorbs weekends, holidays and scraper
        gaps. The history chart carries a <strong>84-day (12-week)</strong> window for four routes (the three FBX11
        coffee lanes plus VN→LA); the table carries all seven.
      </P>
      <Highlight>
        <strong>Cadence &amp; a known data-shape caveat.</strong> Freight is scraped <strong>Fridays &amp; Sundays
        only</strong> — verified over three months, FBX prints essentially never moved Mon–Thu. Each run captures a{" "}
        <em>single current value</em>, so the stored history is a step function that holds flat between scrapes rather
        than a true daily series. (A richer full-history capture was designed but not shipped.) Read levels and weekly
        changes, not intra-week wiggles.
      </Highlight>
      <P className="text-[11px] text-slate-500">
        The same route table is consumed by the Research → <strong>Destination In-store</strong> tab, which reads the
        <Code>vn-eu</Code> rate as its FBX11 base and re-applies the multiplier method per destination port. Note the
        multipliers are fixed constants, manually calibrated — they assume each proxy lane tracks FBX directionally at a
        constant ratio, which a Suez/Panama disruption can break.
      </P>

      <H2>2 · Dry-bulk freight — the BDRY fertilizer-cost proxy</H2>
      <P>
        Fertilizer — the largest cash input on a Brazilian coffee farm — moves as <strong>dry bulk</strong>
        (Capesize/Supramax), not in containers, and its landed (CIF) cost rises and falls with dry-bulk freight. With no
        free real-time dry-bulk index, the model uses <strong>BDRY</strong> (Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF, NYSE
        Arca), which holds a rolling book of Capesize + Supramax freight <em>futures</em>, as a tradable daily proxy.
      </P>
      <Fml>{`MoM = (last / close[-22] − 1) × 100      (~22 trading days ≈ 1 month)
WoW = (last / close[-5]  − 1) × 100      (~5 trading days  ≈ 1 week)
+ 52-week low / high range bar`}</Fml>
      <P>
        The read: <strong>rising BDRY → tighter dry-bulk freight → higher CIF fertilizer cost into Brazil → margin
        pressure on growers</strong>. It is a daily Yahoo-Finance pull feeding the Freight tab and the farmer-economics
        fertilizer block. Caveat: BDRY is an ETF on futures, exposed to roll yield and equity-market noise — a proxy for
        cost <em>pressure</em>, not a freight rate.
      </P>

      <H2>3 · Port activity — IMF PortWatch (satellite AIS)</H2>
      <P>
        Rates tell you cost; port activity tells you <strong>physical flow</strong>. The model pulls IMF PortWatch&rsquo;s
        daily dataset (built on UN Global Platform AIS satellite tracking) for eleven hand-picked coffee export gateways
        — Ho Chi Minh, Santos, Vitória, Buenaventura, Cartagena, Panjang, Tanjung Priok, Puerto Cortés, Puerto Quetzal,
        Djibouti (outlet for landlocked Ethiopia) and Mombasa.
      </P>
      <UL>
        <LI><strong>Three metrics</strong> — port calls (vessel-arrival count), import and export (estimated trade
          volume in metric tons).</LI>
        <LI><strong>Five vessel types</strong> — container, dry-bulk, general-cargo, ro-ro, tanker — each metric is also
          split by type, so the coffee-relevant container/export flow can be isolated.</LI>
        <LI><strong>History from 2021</strong>, refreshed weekly (Wednesdays, after PortWatch&rsquo;s Tuesday update).</LI>
      </UL>
      <P className="text-[11px] text-slate-500">
        Caveat: import/export tonnages are <em>AIS model estimates</em>, not customs truth, and totals are all-cargo —
        the coffee signal is inferred from these gateways, not measured bag-by-bag.
      </P>

      <H2>4 · Seasonality — the year-over-year overlay</H2>
      <P>
        Port throughput is highly seasonal (harvest, shipping peaks), so absolute levels are read against the calendar.
        Every year is collapsed onto a common <Code>1…365</Code> day-of-year index so Jan 1 lines up across years
        (Feb 29 is merged onto Feb 28 to keep leap and non-leap years aligned). The chart then draws the current year,
        the two prior years, and a grey <strong>min–max band</strong> across all earlier years, plus a year-to-date
        comparison:
      </P>
      <Fml>{`day value  = Σ over active vessel types of metric_<type>
band       = [min, max] across prior years (excludes current)
YTD %      = (Σ current YTD − Σ prior-year same-window) / prior × 100`}</Fml>
      <P className="text-[11px] text-slate-500">
        The band is a full min–max envelope (sensitive to a single outlier year), and the current year is naturally
        incomplete past today. Daily and cumulative views are both available; everything recomputes client-side from the
        PortWatch JSON when you toggle vessel types.
      </P>
