 * /news — the daily-newspaper landing page.
 *
 * Three sections, top-to-bottom:
 *   1. FreshnessGrid     — what changed since yesterday, by category
 *   2. UpcomingCalendar  — what's publishing in the next 30 days
 *   3. HeadlinesDigest   — recent stories from /data/news.json, grouped
 *
 * Each is independent and degrades gracefully when its data file is
 * missing. The page is plain composition over existing primitives.
